    <h2> <i>You share your information</i></h2>
    <p><strong>Many of our services let you share information with other people,</strong> and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on <b><i>YouTube</i></b> publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.</p>
    <p>When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads, depending on your Shared Endorsements setting.

We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.</p>
